NFT ticketing is precisely what it sounds like: tickets in the form of an NFT living on a blockchain that act as access passes for any live (or even virtual) event. How is this different than digital tickets? The blockchain factor really sets NFT tickets apart from their barcode or QR code-based counterparts.

With NFT tickets, ticket issuers and recipients can benefit in several ways. Issuers can keep a more in-depth record of attendance numbers by utilizing the blockchain as a ledger, while simultaneously interacting with ticket holders in a new and innovative way via NFTs.

Issuers can send out notices, host surprise giveaways, create token-gated sites and services, and more simply by collating data associated with holders of a specific NFT ticket.

Similarly, NFT ticket holders donâ€™t simply receive a ticket to an event, but an immutable and often interactive digital asset that grants their entry into a show or festival. These tickets also grant holders access to exclusive experiences, including fan clubs made up only of holders of similar NFT tickets.
